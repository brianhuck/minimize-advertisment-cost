# minimize-advertisment-cost
I solve an introductory ops research problem using google's ortools package in Python.

This problem is taken from the book, 'Ops Research: Applications and Algorithms 3rd ed,' by Wayne L. Winston on page 61.

PROBLEM 

Suppose a jewlery company wants to purchase ads on t.v. since their 
primary customers are high-income men and women.  They focus their attention on 
football games and comedy shows.  Each comedy comercial is seen by 7 million high 
income women and 2 million high income men.  Football adverts are seen by 2 million
high income women and 12 million high income men.  One comedy ad costs $50K
and one football ad costs $100K.  The company would like the commercials to be seen
by at least 28 high income women and 24 million high income men. Minimize cost.
